persona
  ☐ Input output should all use observables.
  ☐ Use grapevine's listen
  ☐ Parse the template for elements, slots, attributes, etc.
  ☐ Split locator to watcher and renderer.
  ☐ Renderer nodes should be source node, watcher should be stream node.
  ☐ Expose observers for outputs, instead of events (see text-input).
  ☐ onDom should be a watcher.
  ☐ Make sure no locators need the type. Type should be available in the ID.
